Chat application written in C and driven by TLS sockets. Created after a month and a half of work with my team. My responsibility was server(excluding 'security' and 'sql_functions' folders with header files)

Users of this site can:
- chat in real time
- see if other users are online
- modify own account information
- create groups
- manage groups
- filter own contacts and groups by search
- admins can create, deactivate and activate users
